## How to play 
1) The game randomly selects a word from a pre-defined list of words.

2) You are given 6 chances to guess the word by guessing one letter at a time.
  
3) For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn on the screen, representing a person being hanged. The number of incorrect guesses allowed before the 'hangman' is complete and the game is lost is usually predetermined.
  
4) If  you guesses a letter that appears in the word, all instances of that letter in the word are revealed.
  
5) You wins the game if you correctly guess the entire word before the hangman is fully drawn.

6) If you loses the game the correct word is revealed and the game is over
